# Iris Classification using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a simple machine learning project that demonstrates the use of logistic regression to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal measurements. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for practicing classification algorithms.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and width of the sepals and petals in centimeters. You can find the dataset in the `data` folder.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `scikit-learn`: For implementing logistic regression and preprocessing the data.
- `matplotlib and seaborn`: For data visualization.

## Results
The logistic regression model achieves a certain accuracy on the Iris dataset, which is shown in the Jupyter Notebook. You can experiment with different hyperparameters or feature engineering techniques to improve the model's performance.
